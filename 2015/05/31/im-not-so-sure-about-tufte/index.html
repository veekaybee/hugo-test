<p>A couple years ago, I was fortunate enough to be able to catch <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte>Edward Tufte</a>, the father of the current wave of thinking about data visualization, at a seminar he was giving in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>I, like many people at the seminar, were really excited by the examples of visual presentation based on Tufte&rsquo;s books, as well as his declaration that PowerPoint is evil.</p>
<p>But, looking back on the seminar, I can&rsquo;t say that I came away with anything practical to take back to work. I was, at the time, specifically looking for very concrete guidelines for how to un-uglify Excel graphs for presentation to executives. Today, I&rsquo;m very interested in how to make R output look good.</p>
<p>Tufte does have some general bullets:
+ no clutter (aka &ldquo;chartjunk&rdquo;)
+ clear labels
+ the data-ink ratio and
+ sparklines</p>
<p>but I was looking for something more specific, with examples in spreadsheets or code. The closest I&rsquo;ve come so far is the stuff on <a href=http://www.juiceanalytics.com/data-fluency/>Juice Analytics' website</a>. I&rsquo;ve also come up with a couple principles on my own, garnered from personal experience and picked up from colleagues.</p>
<h2 id=a-couple-of-rules-for-clear-visual-presentation>A couple of rules for clear visual presentation:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re making a PowerPoint, make it easy to email to other people and make the context easily discernible from the slides. If you do good work, it will get around the organization.</li>
<li>Include sources for all of your images in each image and slide, including when you pulled the data.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use red and green. Use neutral tones like blue, beige, and light green together. Use <a href=http://www.colourlovers.com/>ColourLovers</a> if you need hints.</li>
<li>Make it easy to reproduce (either have some link to your code or make it easy to look under the hood.)</li>
<li>NEVER use Excel default charts. Take out the extra grid lines. Make the font larger, more legible, and make it the same across all your presentations.</li>
</ul>
