<p><a href=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/spotify-2012-5/>Five million years</a> after it became popular, I&rsquo;ve gotten into Spotify. The thing I like the most about the service is the curated content.</p>
<p>When I was working with television viewing data, my boss at the time had a hypothesis that there are two viewing behaviors,</p>
<ul>
<li>Flipping through the channels to see what&rsquo;s on
or</li>
<li>Actively seeking out a show.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same is true for music: you&rsquo;re either actively looking for a song, or you want to listen to a &ldquo;channel.&rdquo; If I just want to play specific songs, I use my own music on my phone or go to YouTube. If I want channels, I&rsquo;ll use Spotify.</p>
<p>Spotify is really great at building channels not only by genre, but by intangible things like mood. &ldquo;Coffeehouse chill&rdquo; is one of my favorites. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is still the case, but <a href=http://www.cnet.com/news/spotify-adds-human-touch-to-help-people-find-playlists/>initially</a>, Spotify had a staff of 35 people working on this curation problem by creating manual lists.</p>
<p>Every day, there is a new collection of playlists up on my app. Because they are so carefully managed to show relevant lists by time of day, I love this section and check it out first:</p>
<p><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/master/images/confidence.png alt=image></p>
<p>Last week, Spotify created a list called &ldquo;20 Million Thank Yous,&rdquo; which it created when the service reached 75 million active users and 20 million premium subscribers.</p>
<p><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/master/images/20mil.png alt=image></p>
<p>This number is pretty impressive, but, as a data person, I was immediately curious how they came up with it, because there is no such thing as active users.</p>
<p>Well, there definitely is. There are people using Spotify all the time.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the definition of active?</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it someone who&rsquo;s signed up for Spotify?</li>
<li>Is it someone who&rsquo;s signed up for Spotify and created a profile?</li>
<li>Is it someone who&rsquo;s played one song?</li>
<li>Is it someone who&rsquo;s played one song in the past minute? week? Month? Year?</li>
<li>Is it someone who spends 30 minutes on the site a day? What if they&rsquo;re on the app but have the sound muted and forgot it&rsquo;s playing?</li>
<li>Is it someone who likes to create playlists?</li>
</ul>
<p>This problem is <a href=http://www.quora.com/How-do-different-sites-define-and-quantify-active-users>relevant</a> across all industries, particularly those who operate on the web, and numerous companies have tried to tackle the issue in different ways.</p>
<p>No one has a single answer, because intrinsic human intellectual activity such as &ldquo;listening,&rdquo; &ldquo;viewing,&rdquo; or &ldquo;using&rdquo; is usually very hard to define.</p>
<p>I once worked on a research project trying to measure knowledge worker productivity, and it, like many discussions about how to tell whether developers are productive, ended in no concrete answer.</p>
<p>As a result, for simplicity&rsquo;s sake, PR usually just uses the most impressive number the data team comes up with.</p>
<p>Because of this, it&rsquo;s important to be critical of any usage number you hear about.</p>
<p>For example, <a href=http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/>Facebook usually says </a> they have almost a billion active users for any given month.</p>
<p><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/master/images/fbstats.png alt=image></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 13% of the world&rsquo;s total population logging in every month! That&rsquo;s enormous! How does anyone get any work done when almost 1/7 of the entire world is just reposting gifs of slow lorises?</p>
<p><img src=https://38.media.tumblr.com/500736338e23d5b5adb0201b6b74cbc9/tumblr_mmyemrrqkq1s1fx0zo1_500.gif alt=image></p>
<p>The answer is that obviously not that many people are actively using Facebook, depending on Facebook&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;active.&rdquo; Is active..</p>
<ul>
<li>People who have ever logged into Facebook?</li>
<li>People who log into Facebook x times a day?</li>
<li>People who comment at least x times as a day?</li>
<li>People who like people&rsquo;s statuses?</li>
<li>People who have over 100 friends?</li>
</ul>
<p>Just think about how many of your Facebook friends post at any given time. It&rsquo;s usually probably around 20-30%. The rest are all dormant, just creeping on people&rsquo;s slow loris gifs.</p>
<p>Facebook itself notes how crazy hard it is to measuring people in its 10k statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are **inherent challenges **in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, there may be individuals who maintain one or more Facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service. We estimate, for example, that &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; accounts (an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account) may have represented between approximately 4.3% and 7.9% of our worldwide MAUs in 2013.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s corporate speak for &ldquo;We guesstimate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to <a href=http://www.quora.com/How-does-Facebook-calculate-the-number-of-MAUs-Monthly-Active-Users>Facebook&rsquo;s 10k statement</a>, the way Facebook does measure that funny term, MAUs, is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our Messenger app, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her Facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with Facebook, in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty broad. Although it does mean you have to have logged in AND shared something, it could also mean you are logged into Facebook through third-party apps unkowingly. It also includes anyone who has logged in at least once in a single month, which power Facebook users will tell you is a pretty long span of time.</p>
<p>The point is not that measurement is impossible, but that every company will measure this kind of stuff differently, and if you are a stockholder, developer, or even just plain user, it&rsquo;s important to keep an ear tuned for how analytics can be manipulated.</p>
