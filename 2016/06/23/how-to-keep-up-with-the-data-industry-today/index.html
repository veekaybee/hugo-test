<p>A coworker recently asked how people keep up with everything that&rsquo;s going on in Big Data, and I ended up writing a lot, which I thought I&rsquo;d post here.</p>
<p>For reference, I do daily work as a data scientist mostly in Python these days, but I&rsquo;ve done R and Hadoop in the past.</p>
<p>I see Big Data as a subset of data engineering, which is really just a subset of overall development concepts, so while I try to read articles specific to new data technologies like Spark and Cassandra, I also read as many general development sources as I can to better understand systems.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/>Hacker News</a></strong> - I read Hacker News on a daily basis. It&rsquo;s the best source for news and commentary of everything going on in the tech world in the United States today. I click specifically on articles related to data and check out the comments to see what practical experience people have. I also try to read about things I&rsquo;m not familiar with.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, right now on the front page, there is a post called &ldquo;An APL Compiler targeting a Typed Array Intermediate Language&rdquo;. I have no idea what most of this means, but I&rsquo;ll click through anyway and check out the source code to see how the code is structured on GitHub. Then I&rsquo;ll google around to find out what&rsquo;s special about typed array intermediate languages. Then I&rsquo;ll check out the GitHub repo author&rsquo;s homepage. After doing this kind of internet wandering for months upon months, you start to be familiar with the tech scene and the terminology around it.</p>
<ol start=2>
<li><strong>Newsletters</strong> - I receive several data science newsletters that I pick relevant links out of to read and cross-reference with Hacker News. A few favorites:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.nosqlweekly.com/>NoSQL Weekly</a></li>
<li><a href=http://www.pythonweekly.com/>Python Weekly </a></li>
<li><a href=http://datascienceweekly.org/>Data Science Weekly</a></li>
<li><a href=https://rjmetrics.com/ds-roundup/>DS Roundup</a></li>
</ul>
<ol start=3>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - I find Twitter to be really noisy and not as enjoyable as it used to be even as little as two years ago. But there are still a few people tweeting good links, and who generate industry discussion</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev>@thepracticaldev</a> is one of the best Twitter accounts to get a feel for the zeitgeist of software development today and has lots of good links</li>
<li><a href=https://twitter.com/randal_olson>@randal_olson</a> is really good about catching all the hot data science links of the day and at generating a community of commentary around those links</li>
<li><a href=https://twitter.com/b0rk>@b0rk</a> is probably one of the friendliest public faces in tech today, very generous with her knowledge, and contagious in her enthusiasm for the topic.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=4>
<li><strong>Reddit</strong> - A couple of subreddits have discussion that is at the quality of Hacker News and maybe even more because they focus less on abstract ideas and more on actual examples.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/>r/learnpython</a> - for nuances you missed the first time arond</li>
<li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/>r/python</a> - After you&rsquo;re done learning and have general questions</li>
<li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/>r/programming</a> - Sometimes the same posts as Hacker News, but often even more technical rather than startup-y and offer broader discussion</li>
<li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/>r/statistics</a> - Sometimes good discussions that really get into the nitty gritty</li>
<li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/>r/machinelearning</a> - Getting to be a more active community with lots of good links and pointers</li>
<li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/>r/cscareerquestions</a> - More for junior devs just starting in their careers, but has a lot of good discussion about salary negotiations, different work environments, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For entertainment as well as education:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/>r/sysadmin</a> and <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/>r/talesfromtechsupport</a> - The best groan-worthy stories online. Also you learn a lot about how not to do devops.</li>
<li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/>r/programmerhumor</a> - Self-explanatory</li>
</ul>
<ol start=5>
<li>
<p><a href=http://arxiv.org/><strong>Arxiv</strong></a> - A popular repository of freely-accessible academic papers. It has sections that tell you the latest papers that have been published or are close to publication for a particular domain of knowledge. I check out what&rsquo;s new under the fields of <a href=http://arxiv.org/list/cs.DB/recent>Databases</a>, Statistics, and keywords relevant to data engineering systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m part of a <strong><a href=https://twitter.com/luckymethod/status/621930357873582080>data engineering slack</a></strong> where people talk about issues they&rsquo;ve had at their company and how they&rsquo;re solving them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I go to <strong>local meetups</strong> and ask what people are using in their big data/ data engineering stacks. Two really good ones I went to recently were <a href=http://paperswelove.org/>Papers We Love Philly</a>, and the <a href=http://scala-phase.org/>Philly Area Scala Enthusiasts</a> lecture on DataFrames in Spark. I also love <a href=http://www.meetup.com/DataPhilly/>DataPhilly</a> and <a href=http://www.meetup.com/phillypug/>PhillyPUG</a> and attend as much as family life allows.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I also talk to my friends in the industry. What are they using? What are they not doing? What&rsquo;s in? What&rsquo;s out? Which vendors are they evaluating?</p>
<p>A helpful but hard way to find your way around the market is to go on job interviews. When I was interviewing last year, I got to know a LOT of local company tech stacks and common problem-solving patterns. I recommend this if you&rsquo;re actually looking for a job&mldr;otherwise, informational interviews could work.</p>
<ol start=8>
<li>
<p>I subscribe to <strong>mailing lists of development projects</strong> I&rsquo;m interested in. For example, I&rsquo;m in the <a href=http://spark.apache.org/community.html>Spark mailing list</a>, as well as <a href=https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/scikit-learn-general>scikit-learn</a>. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about people&rsquo;s various use cases and issues from these mailing lists, as well as common architecture patterns. I archive them all in my gmail so I can reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong> - I surf it from time to time to see what&rsquo;s popular, and to see how to write good code and code documentation. It&rsquo;s particularly useful to see how to structure specific blocks of code in real live projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stack OverFlow</strong> - Excellent source for answers, but I also sometimes just browse <a href=http://stats.stackexchange.com/>Cross Validated</a>, the stas sister site, to see what&rsquo;s popular and what people are answering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>O&rsquo;Reilly and Manning emails</strong> - I bought books from them at one point and still get the emails. The latest book announcements are a good signal of what tech is in demand. They also sometimes have interesting free webinars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Podcasts</strong> - I&rsquo;ll binge-listen to a bunch every few months. There are starting to be some really high-quality data-driven podcasts out there. The trick is finding ones where the creators have a good back-and-forth and get into the tech right away as opposed to chatting about the weekend for 40 minutes.</p>
