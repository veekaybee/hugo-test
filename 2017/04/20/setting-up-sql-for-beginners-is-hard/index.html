<p>Edvard Munch, Building The Winter Studio. Ekely</p>
<p>Although there has been a huge backlash against traditional programming paradigms, particularly relational databases, <a href=http://veekaybee.github.io/strata/>over the past several years</a>, SQL is <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/insights/survey/2017#technology-programming-languages>still one of the most popular programming languages</a>.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s proven (working in production settings for over forty years). Second, its human-language-like syntax and declarative nature make it a perfect stepping stone for people who have zero programming knowledge and get overwhelmed by having to start learning by understanding data types and loops. When I started working in analytics, it was the first language I learned. I love teaching it to people new to/outside of technology and seeing them understand the power of being able to manipulate a data programmatically without <em>shudder</em> Excel spreadsheets.</p>
<p>With imperative programming languages, you can get started pretty quickly. You might need to install JDK, download an IDE, and update a couple of dependencies, but as soon as you have your environment set up, you&rsquo;re writing code. (For beginners, <a href=http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2013/07/cooking-100-stir-frys/>it&rsquo;s not always as easy as that</a>), but usually half an hour of poking around or so should get you going.</p>
<p>And, if you don&rsquo;t want to, you don&rsquo;t even have to deal with any of that. You can just go to Code Academy, CodingBat, or, more recently, sites like <a href=https://glitch.com/>Glitch</a>, where the entire environment is already rendered in the browser for you, and start practicing.</p>
<p>The point is, because most modern programming languages are set up to move data rather than analyze it, they have a much lower overhead than SQL. The problem with SQL is that you can&rsquo;t just get started. You need data, for that data to ideally be in several tables that are related to one another, loaded into a database, and made available in a way that you can access that database on your laptop. None of this is something beginners can easily do.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, even though SQL is so well-established and has so many users, there simply aren&rsquo;t a lot of environments already set up for practicing it. I encountered this interesting quirk of the programing community when I first learned it, and unfortunately, not much has changed.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I was asked by <a href=https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/philadelphia>Girl Develop It</a> to teach SQL to others, which I thought was a fantastic idea because of what I&rsquo;ve already written about accessibility for beginners. The first time I taught it in 2013, there was nothing already set up out of the box for me to use.</p>
<p>My criteria included:</p>
<ol>
<li>Has to have an extremely easy to use UI for people who have never written code (so, no command line)</li>
<li>Has to be cross-system compatible since students have a range of machines</li>
<li>Accessible on any browser</li>
<li>Involves no pre-installation before starting the class (so, no Docker containers)</li>
<li>Is mostly open-source</li>
</ol>
<p>My solution:</p>
<p>Running PHPMyAdmin on an AWS instance.</p>
<p>People really love to hate on PHP and the LAMP stack in general (I know I do,) but when something works, it just works.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I did to set up a MySQL PHPMyAdmin database for my students to practice on:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start up an AWS medium Ubuntu instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the <a href=http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-install-lamp-on-ubuntu>LAMP stack</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install <a href=http://askubuntu.com/questions/705880/how-to-install-php-7>PHP 7</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install Python so I could run <a href=https://github.com/veekaybee/intro-to-sql/blob/master/python/addusers.py>create users scripts</a> and a couple of other clean-ups for the environment:</p>
<p>A. Install easyinstall</p>
<p>B. Easy intall <a href=http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2010/02/how-install-pip-ubuntu/_>pip</a></p>
<p>C. <code>sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev build-essential</code></p>
<p>D. Install a <a href=https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python>MySQL client for Python</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the database: <code>sudo service mysql start</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a <a href=https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db>sample dataset to load into the DB</a> and follow instructions on the GitHub page to get it up and running.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And, phew. You&rsquo;re ready to go.</p>
<p>I just taught the SQL class again several weekends ago, and the set-up worked really well for 20-ish students, except for a moment when a cartesian join query made a couple of the instances hang, but I plan to refactor that in the next go-around.</p>
<p>After I presented, I wanted to see if anything new had come onto the market. The only promising new product was <a href=https://modeanalytics.com/>Mode Analytics</a> (h/t <a href=http://www.saracanfield.com>Sara</a>, which requires a sign-up and also is oriented towards Jupyter notebooks as opposed to pure SQL programming.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the class I <a href=https://veekaybee.github.io/intro-to-sql/#/1>ended up teaching</a>. Hope this helps in case you&rsquo;re thinking about teaching SQL, as well.</p>
