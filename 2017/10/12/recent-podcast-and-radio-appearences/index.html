<p>I love exploring technical topics by writing about them. But, a lot of data science work involves explaining the breadth of your complicated model in 20 minutes at a meeting. So, I set a goal of becoming a better public speaker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given a lot of conference talks, but this has been my first year being on both podcasts and public radio(!). What&rsquo;s exciting and hard about audio (especially when it&rsquo;s live) is that you have to express yourself clearly in a limited amount of time, knowing that the recording will then be around for posterity. And man, do I hate listening to the sound of my own voice.</p>
<p>As a side note, a resource that really helped me prepare for these was <a href=https://trackchanges.postlight.com/be-our-guest-f9c962575055>Paul Ford&rsquo;s Guide for People Doing Media Things.</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been on three different podcasts/radio shows, and hopefully it&rsquo;s not too obvious which one was first and which was the most recent ;).</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=http://adversariallearning.com/episode-12-data-science-myths.html>Adversarial Learning</a> - We talked about data science myths, and went on a lot of fun tangents. It&rsquo;s a lot like having a drink with a friend in industry and just shooting the breeze, but you end up learning something, too.</li>
<li><a href=http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/74886>Techtonic</a> - This one was live radio, and Mark and I discussed the mechanics of sharing your day-to-day life on Facebook, what kinds of algorithms Facebook uses to keep track of you, and the general implications of data collection. And we had a call-in all the way from Norway!</li>
<li><a href=https://www.thedatalab.io/podcasts/2017/10/4/vicki-boykis>Data Lab</a> - I talked about my recent Alice in Python packageland post, what T-shaped skills are, and what I enjoy about consulting.</li>
