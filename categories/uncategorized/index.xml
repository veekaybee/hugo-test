“Luke, you’re going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. ”
-Obi-Wan Kenobi, Return of the Jedi
When I was twelve, my family had been in America for seven years, and we could finally afford the American Dream. My parents sold our tiny, grimy duplex in exchange for a larger house in a much better school district.</description></item><item><title>Diaper by diaper and bottle by bottle</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-10-07-diaper-by-diaper-and-bottle-by-bottle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2015 07:20:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-10-07-diaper-by-diaper-and-bottle-by-bottle/</guid><description>I am reading about someone who has a lot of followers on Twitter. She just had a baby, and I am outraged. “Can you believe this,” I say to Mr. B. “She writes that childbirth was ‘beautiful,’ and that she’ll be offline for a bit because she, her husband, and her baby will be ‘falling in love with each other’ for the foreseeable future. ”
Mr. B looks up from his computer.</description></item><item><title>We are not getting the full story about the choices we make</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-09-02-we-are-not-getting-the-full-story-about-the-choices-we-make/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2015 07:43:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-09-02-we-are-not-getting-the-full-story-about-the-choices-we-make/</guid><description>My last semester of MBA classes started last week. Although I am still at home Thursday through Sunday with Baby B, I no longer see her on Mondays and Wednesdays after eight in the morning, the time I leave for work. Additionally, I now usually have class group work to do on the nights when I am home and we’ve put her to bed. People always say to me, “I don’t know how you do it,” and I answer truthfully.</description></item><item><title>Reddit was amazing</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-06-11-reddit-was-amazing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2015 11:56:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-06-11-reddit-was-amazing/</guid><description>In its early years, the Soviet Union was not like what we think of the Soviet Union today: closed, totalitarian, single-minded. The fresh, new feel of the revolution made Russia feel like a whole new world for artists and writers alike. The government, just a baby itself and energized by this brave new world it had created, pushed for many progressive ideas. In addition to banning private property, it also gave women equal rights to men under marriage, legalized abortion, and gave legitimacy to children born out of wedlock.</description></item><item><title>It is hard to talk to my baby in Russian</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-05-28-it-is-hard-to-talk-to-my-baby-in-russian/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2015 07:56:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-05-28-it-is-hard-to-talk-to-my-baby-in-russian/</guid><description>There is a meme going around the internet that is a picture with two eggs on it. The first, on the left, is a whole egg, round and white and smooth. The second, on the right, is the egg smashed into tiny bits and pieces. The whole egg is your brain before kids, and the right egg is your brain after kids.
I’ve found this to be accurate. Before I thought about all kinds of esoteric things, like the Kurdish oil region in Iraq, random blogs I used to read three years ago (what happened to Gubbi of Arabia?</description></item><item><title>No, I will not enjoy every moment</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-03-25-no-i-will-not-enjoy-every-moment/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2015 07:24:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-03-25-no-i-will-not-enjoy-every-moment/</guid><description>When your baby is born, people will tell you “enjoy every moment.” This has always irritated me, but I couldn’t figure out why. Something I saw recently helped me understand why this phrase has always bothered me so much.

The first stage is a blueprint, sketched out hastily on a whiteboard. The second stage is in development, where developers actually write the code. The third stage is integration, where the new, fresh code is blended into existing, working code to make sure there are no compatibility issues. In integration, code can break, compatibility can break, and whole parts of software functions can be rewritten without consequence.</description></item></channel></rss>
