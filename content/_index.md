Hi! I'm Vicki. I'm a [machine learning engineer at Tumblr.](https://applyingml.com/mentors/vicki-boykis/) 

I also like to think about what technology means in the context of society, and write about that,  as well.  In my spare time, I write, read, run and enjoy Nutella. More at my [main site](http://www.vickiboykis.com).
