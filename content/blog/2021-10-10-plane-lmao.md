Airplane on Train, Natalia Goncharova

Last year, I gave [a keynote at RStudio Conf](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/your-public-garden/) where I encouraged people to fight the ennui of pandemic life and the boxed-in social platforms we operate on by building up their digital gardens. 

I gave a few smaller examples of ways to do that, and now I have another one: building fun Streamlit apps. 

Last year, I built [a Streamlit app that did natural language processing to generate thinkpieces](http://veekaybee.github.io/2020/06/09/ml-in-prod/).

This year, I had another excuse to do a small fun thing: A few days ago, [John Nelson](https://generativist.falsifiable.com/index.html) started riffing on the survivorship bias airplane that we see so often it's become a data science meme, and wrote some awesome code that separates the plane and the surface area of the dots and generates random dot configurations:

I decided to riff on that and make a plane that you can customize:

[Here it is in Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/veekaybee/plane_lmao/main/planelit.py), and [here is the code if you want to riff on it.](https://github.com/veekaybee/plane_lmao) 

Enjoy!
