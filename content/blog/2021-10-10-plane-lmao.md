Airplane on Train, Natalia Goncharova

Last year, I gave [a keynote at RStudio Conf](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/your-public-garden/) where I encouraged people to fight the ennui of pandemic life and the boxed-in social platforms we operate on by building up their digital gardens. 

I gave a few smaller examples of ways to do that, and now I have another one: building fun Streamlit apps. 

Last year, I built [a Streamlit app that did natural language processing to generate thinkpieces](http://veekaybee.github.io/2020/06/09/ml-in-prod/).

This year, I had another excuse to do a small fun thing: A few days ago, [John Nelson](https://generativist.falsifiable.com/index.html) started riffing on the survivorship bias airplane that we see so often it's become a data science meme, and wrote some awesome code that separates the plane and the surface area of the dots and generates random dot configurations: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">this was the maximum amount of time i could waste this morning but here is what you need to extend this (lots of smarter ways to do it)<a href="https://t.co/wNVODNzNrw">https://t.co/wNVODNzNrw</a></p>&mdash; (wannabe) Éƒreaker of (the Bad) Loops (@generativist) <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1444352313997418496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I decided to riff on that and make a plane that you can customize: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I didn&#39;t figure out emojis yet (turns out cross-system fonts are complicated), but here it is, good enough for shitposting. Just waiting for that Streamlit Cloud invite. <a href="https://t.co/43nlvhyXXX">https://t.co/43nlvhyXXX</a> want me to do a PR into your demo, or would you prefer to keep it Pristine? <a href="https://t.co/BPYy8v06CI">pic.twitter.com/BPYy8v06CI</a></p>&mdash; Apache Scareflow (@vboykis) <a href="https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/1444707530471575560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

[Here it is in Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/veekaybee/plane_lmao/main/planelit.py), and [here is the code if you want to riff on it.](https://github.com/veekaybee/plane_lmao) 

Enjoy!
