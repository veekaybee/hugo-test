<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll see Wonder Woman, but I was interested in Gal Gadot, and read up a bit about her.</p>
<p>She just had her second daughter at the end of March. March! Which means, just as she was gearing up for a full-on press tour for the movie, she was recovering from childbirth, which, even if you&rsquo;re very in-shape and &ldquo;on&rdquo;, is immensely hard on the body and mind.</p>
<p>On her Instagram feed, there are daily pictures of her at press parties, photo shoots, in New York. A recent picture shows her lying down in a plane, captioned &ldquo;I guess throwing my back out wasn&rsquo;t such a bad idea after allðŸ˜œ This is how I always want to travel!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the entire universe is discussing how this movie is such a positive for women, no one is talking about the people (most likely women) behind the scenes caring for Gadot&rsquo;s daughter, or, just as important, the immense pressure on Gadot to travel and promote this film, even though she should ideally be spending time with her three-month-old, or simply recovering. I like to call this Emerald City Feminism - pay no attention to the men behind the (movie)(camera)(Instagram) screen, calling the financial shots.</p>
