I was home with two kids of a good chunk of the year and worried that the world was ending the rest of the time. When I did read, I wanted to read things where people who were competent solved problems. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to read about (unattainable) travel or anything that felt like life moving foward, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to read anything about the apocalypse.</description></item><item><title>What we've lost</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2020-12-24-what-weve-lost/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2020-12-24-what-weve-lost/</guid><description>This started as a Twitter thread, but one of my long-time goals has been to not put stuff in Twitter threads, so here it is in longer form. Hopefully this is the start of a nice return to blogging for 2021!
A few days ago, I was putting together our physical photo album for 2020. I do this every year because I&amp;rsquo;m terrified that I&amp;rsquo;m going to lose all of our photos into the digital ether.</description></item><item><title>Dear Facebook user 752461218193242</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2018-03-30-dear-facebook-user/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2018-03-30-dear-facebook-user/</guid><description>Apologies to Roy Lichtenstein
According to my Facebook data dump, Mark Zuckerberg knows my birthday, all 40 of my interests, my wedding anniversary, and that time in 2011 that I checked in at a castle in Scotland.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Facebook user since it became available to public universities in 2004 - almost fifteen years of my life and countless hours of effort have been put into status boxes, photo updates, and checkins.</description></item><item><title>Strava and the boat in the data lake</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2018-01-30-strava/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2018-01-30-strava/</guid><description>Dutch Fishing Boats in a Storm, JMW Turner
Several years ago, I wrote that the Snowden revelations changed the way I understood the internet.
I wrote then, that,
I spend a large majority of my day swimming in the sea of data online. I go to Facebook, Twitter, email, weather, this blog, and everywhere else. In the past, I’ve considered this world mine, safe and managed by me, as long as I was smart and sensible.</description></item><item><title>Logs populi or, Thanks, Netflix!</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2017-12-14-logs-populi/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2017-12-14-logs-populi/</guid><description>Earlier this week, Netflix tweeted out a seemingly-innocuous throw-away joke about how comforting it is to watch terrible Lifetime-like movies.
The tweet immediately went viral, but not for the reason Netflix probably imagined. In the process of Brand Building, the company ultimately revealed that it was not above exposing proprietary customer viewing data to hundreds of thousands of people on Twitter for quick laughs.
There is a small caveat: having worked previously with streaming viewing data, I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely convinced the data in the tweet was real.</description></item><item><title>The demise of SoundCloud</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2017-08-11-soundcloud/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2017-08-11-soundcloud/</guid><description>They listen to the gramophone, Makovsky
The winter of 2005 was not easy. I was a sophomore in college, taking a heavy courseload, with a scholarship contingent on grades, and finals were right around the corner. I was also working two jobs. It was cold and dark in State College, Pennsylvania. My roommate and I didn&amp;rsquo;t get along - she wrote a public blog post detailing everything that annoyed her about me, including the fact that I was a loud chewer.</description></item><item><title>JJ Abrams opens the box of my childhood</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-12-28-jj-abrams-opens-the-box-of-my-childhood/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2015 21:55:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-12-28-jj-abrams-opens-the-box-of-my-childhood/</guid><description>[This post contains spoilers of Star Wars, Inside Out, and your childhood.]
“Luke, you’re going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. ”
-Obi-Wan Kenobi, Return of the Jedi
When I was twelve, my family had been in America for seven years, and we could finally afford the American Dream. My parents sold our tiny, grimy duplex in exchange for a larger house in a much better school district.</description></item><item><title>Diaper by diaper and bottle by bottle</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-10-07-diaper-by-diaper-and-bottle-by-bottle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2015 07:20:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-10-07-diaper-by-diaper-and-bottle-by-bottle/</guid><description>I am reading about someone who has a lot of followers on Twitter. She just had a baby, and I am outraged. “Can you believe this,” I say to Mr. B. “She writes that childbirth was ‘beautiful,’ and that she’ll be offline for a bit because she, her husband, and her baby will be ‘falling in love with each other’ for the foreseeable future. ”
Mr. B looks up from his computer.</description></item><item><title>We are not getting the full story about the choices we make</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-09-02-we-are-not-getting-the-full-story-about-the-choices-we-make/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2015 07:43:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-09-02-we-are-not-getting-the-full-story-about-the-choices-we-make/</guid><description>My last semester of MBA classes started last week. Although I am still at home Thursday through Sunday with Baby B, I no longer see her on Mondays and Wednesdays after eight in the morning, the time I leave for work. Additionally, I now usually have class group work to do on the nights when I am home and we’ve put her to bed. People always say to me, “I don’t know how you do it,” and I answer truthfully.</description></item><item><title>How to think in two languages</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-08-07-how-to-think-in-two-languages/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2015 07:29:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-08-07-how-to-think-in-two-languages/</guid><description>This is one in what looks like is becoming a series of posts in how I reconcile growing up mostly in America but wanting to raise my child in Russian.
I need to get something off my chest.
I’ve never read War and Peace. Or Anna Karenina. Or The Brothers Karamazov.
In all the years I’ve been pretending to be an expert on Russian culture, I’ve never read any of the great works of Russian literature.</description></item><item><title>Reddit was amazing</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-06-11-reddit-was-amazing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2015 11:56:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-06-11-reddit-was-amazing/</guid><description>In its early years, the Soviet Union was not like what we think of the Soviet Union today: closed, totalitarian, single-minded. The fresh, new feel of the revolution made Russia feel like a whole new world for artists and writers alike. The government, just a baby itself and energized by this brave new world it had created, pushed for many progressive ideas. In addition to banning private property, it also gave women equal rights to men under marriage, legalized abortion, and gave legitimacy to children born out of wedlock.</description></item><item><title>What do we do with all these photos?</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-06-03-what-do-we-do-with-all-these-photos/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-06-03-what-do-we-do-with-all-these-photos/</guid><description>When I go to visit my grandfather, I often enjoy looking at our family photo album. He was born in the 1930s in the Soviet Union and the pictures start sometime in the 1950s, when he married my grandmother, and go all the way up to today.
That photo album survived 40 years in communism, three apartments, a trans-Atlantic move to the United States, and two moves in Philadelphia. There are maybe 300 pictures in the album, and every single one of them is interesting.</description></item><item><title>It is hard to talk to my baby in Russian</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-05-28-it-is-hard-to-talk-to-my-baby-in-russian/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2015 07:56:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-05-28-it-is-hard-to-talk-to-my-baby-in-russian/</guid><description>There is a meme going around the internet that is a picture with two eggs on it. The first, on the left, is a whole egg, round and white and smooth. The second, on the right, is the egg smashed into tiny bits and pieces. The whole egg is your brain before kids, and the right egg is your brain after kids.
I’ve found this to be accurate. Before I thought about all kinds of esoteric things, like the Kurdish oil region in Iraq, random blogs I used to read three years ago (what happened to Gubbi of Arabia?</description></item><item><title>No, I will not enjoy every moment</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-03-25-no-i-will-not-enjoy-every-moment/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2015 07:24:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-03-25-no-i-will-not-enjoy-every-moment/</guid><description>When your baby is born, people will tell you “enjoy every moment.” This has always irritated me, but I couldn’t figure out why. Something I saw recently helped me understand why this phrase has always bothered me so much.
The first couple weeks after our baby girl was born in January, Mr. B and I could not physically or emotionally summon up the energy to leave the house. Instead, we watched a lot of TV, especially whole seasons of shows that are available on every streaming service possible.</description></item><item><title>Pushing to production</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2014-12-15-pushing-to-production/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2014 12:56:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2014-12-15-pushing-to-production/</guid><description>In the IT world, large software development projects happen in stages. The first stage is a blueprint, sketched out hastily on a whiteboard. The second stage is in development, where developers actually write the code. The third stage is integration, where the new, fresh code is blended into existing, working code to make sure there are no compatibility issues. In integration, code can break, compatibility can break, and whole parts of software functions can be rewritten without consequence.</description></item><item><title>Just make the damn meal</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2014-09-25-just-make-the-damn-meal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2014 07:19:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2014-09-25-just-make-the-damn-meal/</guid><description>Inspired by thisand other NYT hijinks. Just cook. Just cook dinner. We’re all crunched for time, but please, just cook dinner. It’s never easy to cook. We at the New York Times realize this. You might have a million other things going on in your life. You might have just dragged your ass in from night class that lasts from 6-9:30. Your ass, because it is pregnant, may not even feel like it is attached to your body anymore because you sat in a chair designed for a much less pregnant woman for three hours and tried to thoughtfully participate in class discussion even though oh my god you felt like maybe your midregion was detaching from your body.</description></item><item><title>America Online and off</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2018-08-23-america-online-and-off/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2018-08-23-america-online-and-off/</guid><description>In December of 1777, after weeks of drawn-out fighting near Philadelphia, George Washington and his miserable, cowered soldiers, and their families, came to Valley Forge to nurse their wounds for the winter. The mood could not have been bleaker. Philadelphia was occupied by the British. Less than a quarter of the men had shoes. The rest left bloody footprints in the snow. With their little remaining strength, they built cramped, uninsulated, wooden huts for shelter.</description></item><item><title>Democracy in the dark</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2016-12-20-democracy-in-the-dark/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2016-12-20-democracy-in-the-dark/</guid><description>Source.
&amp;ldquo;Where do you think they&amp;rsquo;ll send us when The Deportations start,&amp;rdquo; I ask Mr. B, taking a bite of baklava. It&amp;rsquo;s a weeknight in early December and the cold comes quickly and permeates the dark corners of the house. We are sitting in the kitchen, drinking tea. The toddler is upstairs fast asleep, firmly clutching her lovey in one hand.
It&amp;rsquo;s a blasé, sarcastic question, but like all of my jokes these days, it holds a grain of uncomfortable truth, because I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what the future has in store for me, my family, my kid who doesn&amp;rsquo;t speak English yet, and this entire country.</description></item><item><title>Fix the internet by writing good stuff and being nice to people</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2016-11-20-fix-the-internet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2016-11-20-fix-the-internet/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s internet is mean. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to pinpoint exactly when everyone online became a jerk, but to me it seems that the tipping point occurred right when making money off content started being worth more than the content itself. I wrote the following post before the election but never got around to publishing it. Now, it seems more necessary than ever.
