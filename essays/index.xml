When I was twelve, my family had been in America for seven years, and we could finally afford the American Dream. My parents sold our tiny, grimy duplex in exchange for a larger house in a much better school district.</description></item><item><title>Diaper by diaper and bottle by bottle</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-10-07-diaper-by-diaper-and-bottle-by-bottle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2015 07:20:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-10-07-diaper-by-diaper-and-bottle-by-bottle/</guid><description>I am reading about someone who has a lot of followers on Twitter. She just had a baby, and I am outraged. “Can you believe this,” I say to Mr. B. “She writes that childbirth was ‘beautiful,’ and that she’ll be offline for a bit because she, her husband, and her baby will be ‘falling in love with each other’ for the foreseeable future. ”
Mr. B looks up from his computer.</description></item><item><title>We are not getting the full story about the choices we make</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-09-02-we-are-not-getting-the-full-story-about-the-choices-we-make/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2015 07:43:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-09-02-we-are-not-getting-the-full-story-about-the-choices-we-make/</guid><description>My last semester of MBA classes started last week. Although I am still at home Thursday through Sunday with Baby B, I no longer see her on Mondays and Wednesdays after eight in the morning, the time I leave for work. Additionally, I now usually have class group work to do on the nights when I am home and we’ve put her to bed.

I need to get something off my chest.
I’ve never read War and Peace. Or Anna Karenina. Or The Brothers Karamazov.
In all the years I’ve been pretending to be an expert on Russian culture, I’ve never read any of the great works of Russian literature.</description></item><item><title>Reddit was amazing</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-06-11-reddit-was-amazing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2015 11:56:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-06-11-reddit-was-amazing/</guid><description>In its early years, the Soviet Union was not like what we think of the Soviet Union today: closed, totalitarian, single-minded. The fresh, new feel of the revolution made Russia feel like a whole new world for artists and writers alike. The government, just a baby itself and energized by this brave new world it had created, pushed for many progressive ideas. In addition to banning private property, it also gave women equal rights to men under marriage, legalized abortion, and gave legitimacy to children born out of wedlock.</description></item><item><title>It is hard to talk to my baby in Russian</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-05-28-it-is-hard-to-talk-to-my-baby-in-russian/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2015 07:56:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2015-05-28-it-is-hard-to-talk-to-my-baby-in-russian/</guid><description>There is a meme going around the internet that is a picture with two eggs on it. The first, on the left, is a whole egg, round and white and smooth. The second, on the right, is the egg smashed into tiny bits and pieces. The whole egg is your brain before kids, and the right egg is your brain after kids.
I’ve found this to be accurate.

Something I saw recently helped me understand why this phrase has always bothered me so much.
The first couple weeks after our baby girl was born in January, Mr. B and I could not physically or emotionally summon up the energy to leave the house. Instead, we watched a lot of TV, especially whole seasons of shows that are available on every streaming service possible.</description></item><item><title>Pushing to production</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2014-12-15-pushing-to-production/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2014 12:56:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2014-12-15-pushing-to-production/</guid><description>In the IT world, large software development projects happen in stages. The first stage is a blueprint, sketched out hastily on a whiteboard. The second stage is in development, where developers actually write the code. The third stage is integration, where the new, fresh code is blended into existing, working code to make sure there are no compatibility issues. In integration, code can break, compatibility can break, and whole parts of software functions can be rewritten without consequence.</description></item><item><title>Just make the damn meal</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2014-09-25-just-make-the-damn-meal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2014 07:19:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2014-09-25-just-make-the-damn-meal/</guid><description>Inspired by thisand other NYT hijinks. Just cook. Just cook dinner. We’re all crunched for time, but please, just cook dinner. It’s never easy to cook. We at the New York Times realize this. You might have a million other things going on in your life. You might have just dragged your ass in from night class that lasts from 6-9:30. Your ass, because it is pregnant, may not even feel like it is attached to your body anymore because you sat in a chair designed for a much less pregnant woman for three hours and tried to thoughtfully participate in class discussion even though oh my god you felt like maybe your midregion was detaching from your body.</description></item><item><title>America Online and off</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2018-08-23-america-online-and-off/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2018-08-23-america-online-and-off/</guid><description>In December of 1777, after weeks of drawn-out fighting near Philadelphia, George Washington and his miserable, cowered soldiers, and their families, came to Valley Forge to nurse their wounds for the winter. The mood could not have been bleaker. Philadelphia was occupied by the British. Less than a quarter of the men had shoes. The rest left bloody footprints in the snow. With their little remaining strength, they built cramped, uninsulated, wooden huts for shelter.</description></item><item><title>Democracy in the dark</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2016-12-20-democracy-in-the-dark/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2016-12-20-democracy-in-the-dark/</guid><description>Source.
&amp;ldquo;Where do you think they&amp;rsquo;ll send us when The Deportations start,&amp;rdquo; I ask Mr. B, taking a bite of baklava. It&amp;rsquo;s a weeknight in early December and the cold comes quickly and permeates the dark corners of the house. We are sitting in the kitchen, drinking tea. The toddler is upstairs fast asleep, firmly clutching her lovey in one hand.
It&amp;rsquo;s a blasé, sarcastic question, but like all of my jokes these days, it holds a grain of uncomfortable truth, because I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what the future has in store for me, my family, my kid who doesn&amp;rsquo;t speak English yet, and this entire country.</description></item><item><title>Fix the internet by writing good stuff and being nice to people</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2016-11-20-fix-the-internet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2016-11-20-fix-the-internet/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s internet is mean. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to pinpoint exactly when everyone online became a jerk, but to me it seems that the tipping point occurred right when making money off content started being worth more than the content itself. I wrote the following post before the election but never got around to publishing it. Now, it seems more necessary than ever.

The hipster sparkling water has been everywhere lately, from tech startups, to the millennial female-oriented newsletter I subscribe to to pretend I&amp;rsquo;m still in my 20s and see what all the kids are up to these days.
Recently, I decided to try it and see if I could indeed ascend to a higher spiritual plane while drinking it. I went specifically to my local Whole Foods, where they are super-heavy on selling the stuff recently, picked out a six-pack, and brought it home.</description></item><item><title>Keeping the world away</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2019-06-04-kharms-for-kids/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2019-06-04-kharms-for-kids/</guid><description>One of the best parts of having a four-year-old is that she&amp;rsquo;s finally old enough to request her own bedtime reading. Usually Mr. B does the bedtime routine and reading, but some nights it&amp;rsquo;s me, and we&amp;rsquo;ll turn on her soft, yellow chicken nightlight, and I&amp;rsquo;ll pull up a chair right next to her bed and read.

I&amp;rsquo;d gotten something like an 81, an unforgivable grade in a Russian immigrant family. I remember sitting on the bus, my whole stomach filling with dread at the thought of sharing this grade with my parents.
Kids sat around me on the bus, laughing, the whole weekend full of promise ahead of them. Mine stretched out bleakly before me, my fate and entire future uncertain, the exam with the bad grade sitting there quietly in the backpack next to me.</description></item><item><title>Meghan Markle's heels</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2019-03-06-meghan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2019-03-06-meghan/</guid><description>A couple weeks ago, as Mr. B was putting our preschooler to bed, I was lying on the couch, balancing a container of creamy Icelandic yogurt on my lap, and scrolling through People.com. It&amp;rsquo;s something I do a lot these days because I&amp;rsquo;m four and a half months pregnant, and my brain has completely turned to mush.

Last year, with a newborn and a new job, I had zero time for, or interest in, reading. It was like my brain turned off. This year, the toddler started going to bed at 7:30 and sleeping through the night, and I swam in literature. I luxuriated over having hours and hours of uninterrupted time at night to read books.</description></item><item><title>My Favorite Books of 2017</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2018-01-02-favorite-books/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2018-01-02-favorite-books/</guid><description>Every year, it seems like the books I read are completely random. But, what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over time is that I love books that teach me something about the invisible systems that govern how the world works.
My first revelation was many years ago, when I first read Confessions of an Economic Hitman and understood better how international financial systems really work under the covers. Ever since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the look out for both fiction and non-fiction books that peel back the curtain and show the world for what it really is.</description></item><item><title>My Favorite Books of 2018</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2018-12-27-best-books/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2018-12-27-best-books/</guid><description>This year, in reading, I was looking for an escape in great writing. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter to me whether the writing was fiction or non-fiction, it needed to transport and inspire me. I read nearly 70 books, and for some reason, I had to put down quite a few of them because they weren&amp;rsquo;t getting to the point. Here are my favorites.

The first half of the year, my pregnancy took a lot of time away from me in the form of body-numbing exhaustion. After working and taking care of my daughter all day, I simply collapsed into bed and fell asleep at 7 at night.
In the second half of the year, my baby was born, thus taking away all of the other time I had.</description></item><item><title>My Favorite Books of 2020</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2021-04-16-favorite-books/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2021-04-16-favorite-books/</guid><description>Reading was really hard going in 2020. I was home with two kids of a good chunk of the year and worried that the world was ending the rest of the time. When I did read, I wanted to read things where people who were competent solved problems. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to read about (unattainable) travel or anything that felt like life moving foward, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to read anything about the apocalypse.</description></item><item><title>On competence</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2018-03-07-on-competence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2018-03-07-on-competence/</guid><description>Cosette Sweeping, Emile Bayard 1862
I&amp;rsquo;ve watched at least ten different versions of the musical Les Miserables, including the movie and a junior high performance in a middle school in nowhere, Pennsylvania. Ostensibly the songs and roles are always the same, but each production has its own energy, its own highs, and its own flaws.
The best and worst version of Les Mis is &amp;ldquo;Les Miserables in Concert: The 25th Anniversary.</description></item><item><title>Russia's window to the West</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2016-06-22-russia-window-to-the-west/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2016-06-22-russia-window-to-the-west/</guid><description>I am trying to teach my daughter Russian as her first language, so most mornings while she sits in her high chair and I spoon feed her yogurt, we listen to Russian radio news. While the sun is just rising over Philadelphia and the day is fresh here, it&amp;rsquo;s already closing in on mid-afternoon in Moscow, and both the news and announcers seem stale, worn.

For me, winter means the existential fear of being judged for the way my child is dressed at daycare.
To preserve our family’s language and culture, we send my daughter to a Russian-language daycare. This is all very beautiful and noble, until you realize two things about Russian daycare. The first is that your child can never be warm enough because, if they’re underdressed, they’ll go outside and catch a cold.</description></item><item><title>Talk at Skeptech - Manuscripts don't burn</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2017-06-19-skeptech/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/hugo-test/essays/2017-06-19-skeptech/</guid><description>In April, I gave a talk at Skeptech, a fantastic event put together by Mark Hurst to question what the internet&amp;rsquo;s become lately.
