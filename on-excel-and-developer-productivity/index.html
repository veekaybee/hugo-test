<p>Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin, The girl at the desk (1934)</p>
<p>When I was just starting out in my professional life, I did a lot of Excel.</p>
<p>A LOT of Excel.</p>
<p>I graduated with a B.S. in Economics, outside the realm of anything remotely related to programming, and I didn&rsquo;t realize there was another way to do things. Or rather, I vaguely realized there was something called &ldquo;programming&rdquo; out there, but it was so big and ungraspable that it wasn&rsquo;t on my horizon.</p>
<p>One day in my first couple years in the workforce, I was working late on an Excel sheet for a client deliverable, and it was late, and I was tired, and I had been copying and pasting cells all day. I wrapped up the spreadsheet and my boss said I could go home.</p>
<p>The next day, my spreadsheet was presented at a client meeting (I was muted on the phone, in a different city.) As my boss was presenting it, I could hear him pause and say, &ldquo;Wait, this doesn&rsquo;t look right.&rdquo; I felt my heart drop through my chest. The client also paused, expectantly. I wanted to dig a hole in the ground and die in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vicki, look into these numbers,&rdquo; my boss said, and we wrapped up the call. My boss called me directly. I didn&rsquo;t want to pick up. &ldquo;What happened here,&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mldr;&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t have a good answer. I had messed up, plain and simple. &ldquo;Redo these,&rdquo; he said, and asked a senior associate to check them for me, which mortified me and piled more work on the already-busy senior associate.</p>
<p>I called my mom after work. &ldquo;I messed up big-time,&rdquo; I said, bawling. She comforted me, and told me to check my work more carefully next time, not to rush. Everyone I talked to said it was ok, but not to let it happen again, and to just be more careful in my work.</p>
<p>I spent years double-checking and second-guessing myself, crossing my fingers that all the numbers would end up ok. For many years afterwards, until I became a solid developer, I thought not that Excel needed checks, but that I was a careless employee.</p>
<p>I thought back to that meeting a couple weeks ago as I was writing code, and I felt so angry for that young girl, that no one told her it wasn&rsquo;t her fault - it was the fault of a business world that doesn&rsquo;t value programming skills over hundreds of hours of manual labor, a world that doesn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Hey, humans aren&rsquo;t supposed to do this work - machines are. Let machines handle the number crunching. You&rsquo;re supposed to make mistakes. It&rsquo;s our job to keep you as far away from that as possible with version control, tests, CI, multiple environments, and statistical software.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought about it as I read <a href=https://stripe.com/files/reports/the-developer-coefficient.pdf>Stripe&rsquo;s developer coefficient survey</a>, where they determined that developers are force-multipiers, and that not using developers efficiently led to a $300 trillion drop in productivity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I believe that enormous number, but I believe that knowing that I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to have the burden of moving all the cells accurately all the time would have led to a much different first two years of my career.</p>
